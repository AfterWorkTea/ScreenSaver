# ScreenSaver

Screen Saver Example - sprite object flying over fading out background with system info and clock

This is based on another project (http://www.wischik.com/scr/) by Lucian Wischik.

The credit for original images.* and unzip.* goes to Lucian Wischik.

## My work include:
- Refactored the code to remove old windows references and debugging
- A fade-out effect for the background
- Simple digital clock
- SystemInfo to display system information
- Adjusted project to VS20017 and compiled for Win10
- Replaced graphics resources files
