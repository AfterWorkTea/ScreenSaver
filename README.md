# ScreenSaver

Screen Saver Example - sprite object flying over fading out background with system info and clock

This is a modification of another project (providing images.* and unzip.*) found in internet and has been adjust and compiled with VS2017 for Win10.

## My work include:
- Refactoring the code to remove old windows references and debugging code
- Adding a fade-out effect for the background
- Simple digital clock
- SystemInfo to display system information
- Adjusting project to VS20017 and compiling for Win10
- Replacing graphics
